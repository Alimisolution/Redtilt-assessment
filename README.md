# Redtilt Website Built with ReactJS + Vite

## Introduction

Welcome to the Redtilt website project! This project is built using **ReactJS** and **Vite** for fast development and smooth performance. Below are the steps on how to set up and run the application on your local machine.



## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed:

- **Git**: A version control system to clone the repository.
- **Node.js** (with **npm**): A JavaScript runtime and package manager for managing dependencies.

You can check if Git and Node.js are installed by running the following commands in your terminal:

bash
git --version
node --version
npm --version


# Steps to Run the Application

## 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine. In your terminal, navigate to the folder where you want to store the project and run the following command:

git clone <repository-url>

Replace <repository-url> with the actual URL of the repository. This will create a copy of the repository on your local machine.


## 2. Install Dependencies

Once the repository is cloned, navigate into the project directory by running:

cd <repository-folder>

Then, install the necessary dependencies using npm:

npm install

This will install all the required packages specified in the package.json file. These dependencies include ReactJS, Vite, and other necessary libraries for the app to function.


## 3. Run the Development Server

After the installation is complete, you can start the development server with the following command:

npm run dev

This will start the local development server and compile the application. You should see a message in the terminal similar to this:

  VITE v6.0.1  ready in 414 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
  ➜  press h + enter to show help


## 4. Open the Application in Your Browser

Once the development server is running, you can open the website in your browser by following these steps:

Option 1: Copy the provided local URL (e.g., http://localhost:5173/) and paste it into your browser’s address bar.
Option 2: Hold Ctrl (or Cmd on Mac) and click the URL in your terminal to open it directly in your browser.

The Redtilt website should now be running on your browser, and you can start viewing it on your machine!
